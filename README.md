# cintel-05-cintel-fancy

A bit nicer looking live data example (using random, updating 1x/second)

## Try in the Browser

Go to PyShiny Playground at <https://shinylive.io/py/examples/#basic-app>.

Copy and paste content from [dashboard/app.py](dashboard/app.py) and run.

## Get the Code

Fork this project into your own GitHub account and/or just borrow code from app.py.

Clone your GitHub repo down to your local machine.

Important: Use your GitHub username in place of denisecase and your GitHub repo name in place of cintel-05-cintel-basic.

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) may work better on some machines.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-05-cintel-fancy
```

## Run Locally

Create a local project virtual environment named .venv, activate it, and install the requirements.
When VS Code asks to use it for the workspace, select Yes.

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "View" / "Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands (for Windows - the activate command is slightly different Linux/Mac).

```shell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "View" / "Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
shiny run --reload --launch-browser dashboard/app.py
```

Open a browser to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> and test the app.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Export to docs folder and test GitHub Pages locally.

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "Terminal" / "New Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
shiny static-assets remove
shinylive export dashboard docs
py -m http.server --directory docs --bind localhost 8008
```

Open a browser to <http://[::1]:8008/> and test the Pages app.

## Push Changes back to GitHub

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "Terminal" / "New Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Useful commit message"
git push -u origin main
```

## Enable GitHub Pages

Go to your GitHub repo settings and enable GitHub Pages for the docs folder.
